					<h1>So, what are the <br>
					advantages of PAYFLEXY? </h1>
					<p>
					Today, most ICO projects accept payments only in crypto currencies. But 
					the possibility to accept fiat money will significantly increase the number
					of your investors – as not all of potential clients have possibility to 
					transfer crypto currency. Thus, it is very important for any ICO project 
					to provide investors with the choice of payment method: crypto currency 
					or fiat money, payment card or bank transfer, e-wallet or by cash (for 
					example, Western Union). All these payment methods are offered by PAYFLEXY.
